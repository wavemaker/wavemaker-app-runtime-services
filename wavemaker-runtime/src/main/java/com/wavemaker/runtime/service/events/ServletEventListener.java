/**
 * ServletEventListener provides an interface for EventListeners that want to be concerned with Servlet-level events
 * (such as start/end request, start/end session, etc).
 * 
 * EventListener provides a base interface for services (or groups of services) to handle system events. The
 * EventListener defines a series of callback functions; each callback is called when the system enters that state, with
 * the associated Service as the only parameter.
 * 
 * Each EventListener can listen for multiple events, and multiple types of services. When a request changes state, all
 * registered EventListeners are called with each of their services, in order.
 * 
 * It is also possible for an individual Service to be registered with multiple EventListeners, although the order
 * they'll be called in is not guaranteed.
