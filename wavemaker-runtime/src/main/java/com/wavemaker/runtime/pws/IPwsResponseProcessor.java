/**
 * This interface is implemented by WaveMaker standard class <code>DefaultResponseProcessor</code>. When a web service
 * is called (or requested) in the WaveMaker framework, the standard WaveMaker web service module assumes that the
 * response is in XML format and processes the response using JAXB APIs. Developers can change the standard behaviour by
 * extending <code>DefaultResponseProcessor</code>. Usually, developers may want to override the standard
 * implementations for the following reasons.
 * <p>
 * - The response may need to be manipulated before it is submitted to JAXB APIs or after processed by JAXB.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * - The response is not in XML format. It can be JSON or something else.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * - Exceptions need to be caught explicitly. For example, authorization errors such as expired session need to be
 * caught so that a login attempt can be made.
