     *    request to delete or download files that contains a relative path will
     *    search for the file starting from uploadDir.
     * NOTES:
     *    You can change this value at any time.
     *    You may need to set a different uploadDir for your deployment environment
     *    than you used on your local development environment.

    /********************************************************************************
     * NAME: uploadFile
     * DESCRIPTION: 
     *   The wm.DojoFileUpload widget automatically calls this method whenever the 
     *   user selects a new file.
     *
     * PARAMS:
     * file : multipart file to be uploaded.
     * relativePath : This is the relative path where file will be uploaded.
     *
     * RETURNS DojoFileUploaderResponse 
     *   This has the following fields
     *   Path: tells the client where the file was stored so that the client can
     *         identify the file to the server
     *   Name: tells the client what the original name of the file was so that any 
     *         communications with the end user can use a filename familiar to that user.
     *   Type: returns type information to the client, based on filename extensions (.txt, .pdf, .gif, etc...)
     *   Error:This will NOT trigger an onError, but will allow the user of the widget to 
     *         scan the list of returned files for any errors.
     *   Width/Height: Intended for returning width/height of uploaded images, but in fact 
     *         you can use these to return any custom information you want.
     * NOTES
     *   This is a good starting point for an upload service. However, there are a number of 
     *   things you might want to change
     *   1. File name: you may want to associate a database index with the filename: 
     *      32_hello.png instead of hello.png
     *   2. Folder: you may want to store files someplace other than uploadDir.  Perhaps a folder named
     *      for the table and database index associated with the file.  Instead of uploadDir/hello.png
     *      uploadDir/table1/32/hello.png
     *   3. You may actually want to write the file into a database field
     *   4. You may want to use uploadDir as a "tmp" folder, and await a second
     *      javaservice call before doing something with the files. Just because a file
     *      has uploaded does not mean that the user has hit "Save" to commit all of their changes.
     *   5. Add additional parameters that identify the file, what database entry or user
     *      its associated with, and other details of what to do with the file.  (after
     *      compiling these changes, you may need to recreate your wm.DojoFileUpload widget)
