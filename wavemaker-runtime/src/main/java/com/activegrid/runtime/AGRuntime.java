/**
 * Runtime bean. Provides an interface to the session, request and response objects, and other WaveMaker interfaces.
 * This is the primary interface point for any WaveMaker system access.
 * 
 * This should only be used as a bean property or through the static {@link #getInstance()} method; other instantiation
 * methods are unsupported. Using it as a bean property is recommended (see {@link #getInstance()} for more
 * information). The AGRuntime bean is named runtime, an example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * &lt;bean id=&quot;myServiceBeanId&quot; class=&quot;myServiceBeanClass&quot;
 *          scope=&quot;singleton&quot; lazy-init=&quot;true&quot;&gt;
 *   &lt;property name=&quot;runtime&quot;&gt;
 *       &lt;ref bean=&quot;runtime&quot; /&gt;
 *   &lt;/property&gt;
 * &lt;/bean&gt;
 * </pre>

 * @deprecated AGRuntime is now deprecated; instead, use {@link RuntimeAccess}. In a future release, AGRuntime will be
 *             removed. Also, note that {@link RuntimeAccess} uses a different bean name (runtimeAccess).
