#enable the class reference fix
#Property that indicates whether a legacy fix for a JVM issue related to
#evaluator classes generated by JasperReports is enabled.  The fix is
#enabled by default.
#Due to the fix, the garbage collector might not be able to collect
#a classloader that loaded JasperReports classes. This would be
#inconvenient in scenarios in which JasperReports classes are repeatedly
#loaded by different classloaders, e.g. when JasperReports is part of
#the classpath of a web application which is often reloaded.  In such
#scenarios, set this property to false.
