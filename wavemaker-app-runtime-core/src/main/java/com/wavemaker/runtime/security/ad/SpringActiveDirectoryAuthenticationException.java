/**
 * <p>
 * Thrown as a translation of an {@link javax.naming.AuthenticationException} when attempting to authenticate against
 * Active Directory using {@link org.springframework.security.ldap.authentication.ad.ActiveDirectoryLdapAuthenticationProvider}. Typically this error is wrapped by an
 * {@link org.springframework.security.core.AuthenticationException} since it does not provide a user friendly message. When wrapped, the original
 * Exception can be caught and {@link ActiveDirectoryAuthenticationException} can be accessed using
 * {@link org.springframework.security.core.AuthenticationException#getCause()} for custom error handling.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #getDataCode()} will return the error code associated with the data portion of the error message. For
 * example, the following error message would return 773 for {@link #getDataCode()}.
